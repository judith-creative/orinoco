Project 5 - Build an ecommerce website

For this project I am asked:
-to create 4 pages (one presenting all articles, one product page, one basket page and one confirmation page)
-to present only one category out of 3 (camera, stuffed bear, table) I guess they mean on the product page and pages related
-to plan unitary tests without necessarily writing them
-to use promises in stead of callbacks
